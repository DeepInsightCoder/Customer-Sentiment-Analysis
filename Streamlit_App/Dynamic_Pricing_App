# Sentiment-Based Dynamic Pricing App

This is a **Sentiment-Based Dynamic Pricing** web app built using **Streamlit**. The app allows business users to upload a CSV file containing product prices, customer sentiment data, and dynamically adjusts the pricing based on customer sentiment. It helps businesses optimize pricing strategies based on customer feedback, allowing for more data-driven decision-making.

## Features
- Upload CSV files with columns: **Product**, **Price**, and **Sentiment**.
- Automatically adjust prices based on sentiment scores:
  - **Positive Sentiment** (+1) increases price by 10%.
  - **Negative Sentiment** (-1) decreases price by 10%.
  - **Neutral Sentiment** (0) keeps the price unchanged.
- Display a preview of the data with adjusted prices.
- Download the adjusted pricing data as a CSV file.

## How It Works
1. Upload a CSV file that contains the following columns:
   - **Product**: Name or ID of the product.
   - **Price**: Original price of the product.
   - **Sentiment**: Sentiment score for the product (-1 for negative, 0 for neutral, +1 for positive).
   
2. The app processes the file and adjusts prices based on the sentiment values.
3. You can see a preview of the adjusted data.
4. Option to download the new dataset with adjusted prices.

## Example CSV Format
```csv
Product,Price,Sentiment
Product A,100,1
Product B,150,-1
Product C,200,0
